➸ Please Interact  if you enjoy roleplaying or ships! Ships I enjoy are DanMarch, RenHeng, DanHill, JingHeng, LuoRen, JingLuo, LuiBai, Xingyue, Emilute, Chaggie, AdamsApple, RadioStatic, and HuskerDust. You're just overall a nice person. I love chilling with people that just wanna talk or share interests. Such as ocs, writing, ships roleplays! And Headcanons.

➸ Please do not interact, if you're going to be sexual with me. Yes, it's the 18+ server but there should be NO excuse for pushing boundaries, they exist for a reason! If you're going to just overall be rude, I can and will hide you and your friends if they persist I unhide, I can usually understand jokes but I normally wish to be left alone.
