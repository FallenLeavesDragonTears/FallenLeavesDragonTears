☾About Me☽
➸ I am sen, I am aroace, and my pronouns are they/he/she
➸ I am 25 My Birthday is August 6th
➸ ADHD touch of autism and Depression these are diganosed and something I truly struggle with. I can be pretty shy but I do my best! I am usually seen on ponytown as my Dan Feng skins or my many au skins! I am a high Dan Feng kinnie and I promise, I won't bite (unless you're Yingxing/affectionately) I am currently very hyperfixated on Star Rail and XingYue/FengXing right now so. And no I will not move from the Hammock if you look at me angerily I WILL move if you are polite about it and ask me to. I do not tolerate rudeness.

➸ Please Interact  if you enjoy roleplaying or ships! Ships I enjoy are DanMarch, RenHeng, DanHill, JingHeng, LuoRen, JingLuo, LuiBai, Kafblade, and Xingyue/FengXing. You're just overall a nice person. I love chilling with people that just wanna talk or share interests. Such as ocs, writing, ships roleplays! And Headcanons. Also 🇩‌🇦‌🇳‌ 🇭‌🇪‌🇳‌🇬‌🇸‌ and 🇾‌🇮‌🇳‌🇬‌🇽‌🇮‌🇳‌🇬‌🇸‌ please interact with me I need more content with both of them. I am willing to try different ships including OC X Cannon however, I personally do not ship my ocs with cannon but ya'll are free to ship your ocs with my cannon character ponies. 

➸ Please do not interact, if you're going to be sexual with me. Yes, it's the 18+ server but there should be NO excuse for pushing boundaries, they exist for a reason! If you're going to just overall be rude, I can and will hide you and your friends if they persist I unhide, I can usually understand jokes but I normally wish to be left alone. If I see you being sexual I am 100% going to move out the way and get you off my screen. I won't hide for that but if you start doing it to me I will.
